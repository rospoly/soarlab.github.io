abstract: "<p>
Approximate computing is an emerging area for trading off the accuracy of an
application for improved performance, lower energy costs, and tolerance to
unreliable hardware. However, developers must ensure that the leveraged
approximations do not introduce significant, intolerable divergence from the
reference implementation, as specified by several established robustness
criteria. In this work, we show the application of automated differential
verification towards verifying relative safety, accuracy, and termination
criteria for a class of program approximations. We use mutual summaries to
express relative specifications for approximations, and SMT-based invariant
inference to automate the verification of such specifications. We perform a
detailed feasibility study showing promise of applying automated verification
to the domain of approximate computing in a cost-effective manner.
