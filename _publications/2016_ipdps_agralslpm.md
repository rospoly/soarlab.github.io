abstract: "<p>
OpenMP plays a growing role as a portable programming model to harness on-node
parallelism; yet, existing data race checkers for OpenMP have high overheads
and generate many false positives. In this paper, we propose the first OpenMP
data race checker, Archer, that achieves high accuracy, low overheads on large
applications, and portability. Archer incorporates scalable happens-before
tracking, exploits structured parallelism via combined static and dynamic
analysis, and modularly interfaces with OpenMP runtimes. Archer significantly
outperforms TSan and Intel Inspector XE, while providing the same or better
precision. It has helped detect critical data races in the Hypre library that
is central to many projects at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and
elsewhere.
