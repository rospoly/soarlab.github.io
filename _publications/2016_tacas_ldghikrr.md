abstract: "<p>
We describe JDart, a dynamic symbolic analysis framework for Java. A
distinguishing feature of JDart is its modular architecture: the main component
that performs dynamic exploration communicates with a component that
efficiently constructs constraints and that interfaces with constraint solvers.
These components can easily be extended or modified to support multiple
constraint solvers or different exploration strategies. Moreover, JDart has
been engineered for robustness, driven by the need to handle complex NASA
software. These characteristics, together with its recent open sourcing, make
JDart an ideal platform for research and experimentation. In the current
release, JDart supports the CORAL, SMTInterpol, and Z3 solvers, and is able to
handle NASA software with constraints containing bit operations, floating point
arithmetic, and complex arithmetic operations (e.g., trigonometric and
nonlinear). We illustrate how JDart has been used to support other analysis
techniques, such as automated interface generation and testing of libraries.
Finally, we demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of JDart, and compare
it with state-of-the-art dynamic or pure symbolic execution engines through an
extensive experimental evaluation.
