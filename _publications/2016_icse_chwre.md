abstract: "<p>
Tool prototyping is an essential step in developing novel software verification
algorithms and techniques. However, implementing a verifier prototype that can
handle real-world programs is a huge endeavor, which hinders researchers by
forcing them to spend more time engineering tools, and less time innovating. In
this paper, we present the SMACK software verification toolchain. The toolchain
provides a modular and extensible software verification ecosystem that
decouples the front-end source language details from back-end verification
algorithms. It achieves that by translating from the LLVM compiler intermediate
representation into the Boogie intermediate verification language. SMACK
benefits the software verification community in several ways: (i) it can be
used as an off-the-shelf software verifier in an applied software verification
project, (ii) it enables researchers to rapidly develop and release new
verification algorithms, (iii) it allows for adding support for new languages
in its front-end. We have used SMACK to verify numerous C/C++ programs,
including industry examples, showing it is mature and competitive. Likewise,
SMACK is already being used in several existing verification research
prototypes.
