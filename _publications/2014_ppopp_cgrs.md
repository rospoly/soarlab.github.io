abstract: "<p>
Tools for floating-point error estimation are fundamental to program
understanding and optimization. In this paper, we focus on tools for
determining the input settings to a floating point routine that maximizes its
result error. Such tools can help support activities such as precision
allocation, performance optimization, and auto-tuning. We benchmark current
abstraction-based precision analysis methods, and show that they often do not
work at scale, or generate highly pessimistic error estimates, often caused by
non-linear operators or complex input constraints that define the set of legal
inputs. We show that while concrete-testing-based error estimation methods
based on maintaining shadow values at higher precision can search out higher
error-inducing inputs, suitable heuristic search guidance is key to finding
higher errors. We develop a heuristic search algorithm called Binary Guided
Random Testing (BGRT). In 45 of the 48 total benchmarks, including many
real-world routines, BGRT returns higher guaranteed errors. We also evaluate
BGRT against two other heuristic search methods called ILS and PSO, obtaining
better results.
