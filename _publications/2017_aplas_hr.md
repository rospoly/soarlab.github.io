abstract: "<p>
Static program verifiers based on satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers
often trade precision for scalability to be able to handle large programs. A
popular trade-off is to model bitwise operations, which are expensive for SMT
solving, using uninterpreted functions over integers. Such an
over-approximation improves scalability, but can introduce undesirable false
alarms in the presence of bitwise operations that are common in, for example,
low-level systems software. In this paper, we present our approach to diagnose
the spurious counterexamples caused by this trade-off, and leverage the learned
information to lazily and gradually refine the precision of reasoning about
bitwise operations in the whole program. Our main insight is to employ a simple
and fast type analysis to transform both a counterexample and program into
their more precise versions that block the diagnosed spurious counterexample.
We implement our approach in the SMACK software verifier, and evaluate it on
the benchmark suite from the International Competition on Software Verification
(SV-COMP). The evaluation shows that we significantly reduce the number of
false alarms while maintaining scalability.
