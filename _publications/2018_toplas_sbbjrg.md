abstract: "<p>
Rigorous estimation of maximum floating-point round-off errors is an important
capability central to many formal verification tools. Unfortunately, available
techniques for this task often provide very pessimistic overestimates, causing
unnecessary verification failure. We have developed a new approach called
Symbolic Taylor Expansions that avoids these problems, and implemented a new
tool called FPTaylor embodying this approach. Key to our approach is the use of
rigorous global optimization, instead of the more familiar interval arithmetic,
affine arithmetic, and/or SMT solvers. FPTaylor emits per-instance analysis
certificates in the form of HOL Light proofs that can be machine checked.  In
this paper, we present the basic ideas behind Symbolic Taylor Expansions in
detail. We also survey as well as thoroughly evaluate six tool families, namely
Gappa (two tool options studied), Fluctuat, PRECiSA, Real2Float, Rosa and
FPTaylor (two tool options studied) on 24 examples, running on the same
machine, and taking care to find the best options for running each of these
tools. This study demonstrates that FPTaylor estimates round-off errors within
much tighter bounds compared to other tools on a significant number of case
studies. We also release FPTaylor along with our benchmarks, thus contributing
to future studies and tool development in this area.
