abstract: "<p>
Despite the growing popularity of GPGPU programming, there is not yet a
portable and formally-specified barrier that one can use to synchronise
across workgroups. Moreover, the occupancy-bound execution model of GPUs
breaks assumptions inherent in traditional software execution barriers,
exposing them to deadlock. We present an occupancy discovery protocol that
dynamically discovers a safe estimate of the occupancy for a given GPU and
kernel, allowing for a starvation-free (and hence, deadlock-free)
inter-workgroup barrier by restricting the number of workgroups according to
this estimate. We implement this idea by adapting an existing, previously
non-portable, GPU inter-workgroup barrier to use OpenCL 2.0 atomic
operations, and prove that the barrier meets its natural specification in
terms of synchronisation.<br>
We assess the portability of our approach over eight GPUs spanning four
vendors, comparing the performance of our method against alternative
methods. Our key findings include: (1) the recall of our discovery protocol
is nearly 100%; (2) runtime comparisons vary substantially across GPUs and
applications; and (3) our method provides portable and safe inter-workgroup
synchronisation across the applications we study.
