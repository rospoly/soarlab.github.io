abstract: "Automated software verification has made great progress recently, and a key enabler of this progress has been the advances in efficient, automated decision procedures suitable for verification (Boolean satisfiability solvers and satisfiability-modulo-theories (SMT) solvers). Verifying general software, however, requires reasoning about unbounded, linked, heap-allocated data structures, which in turn motivates the need for a logical theory for such structures that includes unbounded reachability. So far, none of the available SMT solvers supports such a theory. In this paper, we present our integration of a decision procedure that supports unbounded heap reachability into an available SMT solver. Using the extended SMT solver, we can efficiently verify examples of heap-manipulating programs that we could not verify before."
